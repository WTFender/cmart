In a remarkably short period he became the leading artist of his generation, a reputation fueled through boxing subjects such as <em>Stag at Sharkey\u2019s.</em> In his later years he developed recreational passions for tennis and billiards, which he routinely played with friends.

Founded by Tom \u201cSailor\u201d Sharkey, an ex-fighter who had also served in the US Navy, the club attracted men seeking to watch or participate in matches. Because public boxing was illegal in New York at the time, a private event had to be arranged in order for a bout to take place. Participation was usually limited to members of a particular club, but whenever an outsider competed, he was given temporary membership and known as a \u201cstag.\u201d Although boxing had its share of detractors who considered it uncouth at best or barbaric at worst, its proponents\u2014among them President Theodore Roosevelt\u2014regarded it a healthy manifestation of manliness. Around the time Bellows painted <em>Stag at Sharkey\u2019s, </em>boxing was moving from a predominantly working-class enterprise to one with greater genteel appeal.

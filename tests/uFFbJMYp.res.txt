Because public boxing was illegal in New York at the time, a private event had to be arranged in order for a bout to take place. Participation was usually limited to members of a particular club, but whenever an outsider competed, he was given temporary membership and known as a \u201cstag.\u201d Although boxing had its share of detractors who considered it uncouth at best or barbaric at worst, its proponents\u2014among them President Theodore Roosevelt\u2014regarded it a healthy manifestation of manliness.

In 1866 he entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts where he studied in the ateliers of Jean- Fran\u00e7ois Br\u00e9mond (1807-1868), who taught the young Besnard fresco painting, and Alexandre Cabanel (1823-1889), one of the foremost Second Empire academic painters. Besnard first exhibited at the Salon of 1868, which proved to be the beginning of his official success and in 1874 he won the Prix de Rome, an honor that gave him the opportunity to spend four years at the Villa Medici. Besnard's success as a portraitist began in London, where he stayed from 1879 until 1881. He studied seventeenth-century British portrait painters and emulated the British colorists, Turner (q.v.) in particular. Besnard's reputation as a portrait painter followed him back to Paris where he received numerous commissions from prominent figures of the Third Republic (1870-1940). In addition to portrait painting, Besnard was commissioned by the state to paint mural decorations for various public buildings in Paris. He also experimented with different media such as pastel and etching and designed decorations for stained glass. Besnard received numerous awards and was re-cognized by his contemporaries, including the symbolists. He held the directorships of the \u00c9cole de Rome in 1913 and of the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure Nationale des Beaux-Arts from 1923 to 1934.", "birth_year": "1849", "death_year": "1934", "id": 1859, "artworks": [{"id": 79013, "accession_number": "2016.104", "title": "Four Heads of Women: Study for \u201cThe Happy Island\u201d (Quatre t\u00eates de Femmes: \u00c9tude pour \u201cL\u2019Ile Heureuse\u201d)", "tombstone": "Four Heads of Women: Study for \u201cThe Happy Island\u201d (Quatre t\u00eates de Femmes: \u00c9tude pour \u201cL\u2019Ile Heureuse\u201d), 1899.

In 1886 he enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian, where he was taught by Tony Robert-Fleury (1837-1911) and Bouguereau (q.v.). The following year he was accepted into the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and was briefly in the atelier of G\u00e9r\u00f4me (q.v.). At this time he also studied seventeenth-century Dutch painting and the works of Chardin (1699-1779). By 1889 Vuillard was persuaded by his friend painter and theorist Maurice Denis (1870-1943) to join the newly formed group of artists known as the Nabis. The Nabis based many of their ideas on synthetism, first developed by Gauguin (q.v.) and \u00c9mile Bernard (1868-1941), in which the artist was to work not from nature but from memory. Vuillard's initial synthetist works reveal a preoccupation with pattern and bright colors, denying the three-dimensionality of the object. By 1892, however, his colors were more subdued, reflecting his desire to mimic the unusual lighting effects that he had seen in symbolist theater. Vuillard's first major commissions date from this time, including nine panels for the dining room of Alexandre Natanson and four decorative panels for the library of Dr. Henri Vaquez. In 1898 Vuillard visited Venice and Florence, and the following year he and Bonnard (q.v.), a fellow member of the Nabis, made an excursion to London. Later they went to Milan and Venice and eventually to Spain. Vuillard also made trips to Brittany and Normandy. His first public commission came in 1912, when he was asked to paint panels for the foyer of the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris. During that period he moved beyond the synthetism of the Nabis and returned to a more traditional perspective. At the same time he was accepting commissions for portraits. In 1936 he was chosen to paint a mural at the Palais des Nations in Geneva and was subsequently elected to the Institut de France.", "birth_year": "1868", "death_year": "1940", "id": 1833, "artworks": [{"id": 80329, "accession_number": "2020.118", "title": "Luncheon (Annette and Her Grandmother)", "tombstone": "Luncheon (Annette and Her Grandmother), 1899.
